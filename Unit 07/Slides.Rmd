#  The digital traces of pagers

.center[![:scale 50%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/Dme_motorola.jpg)]
Back in the 90s, [pagers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pager) were a common form of mobile communication. To send a message to a pager, you could call a special phone number, say your message, and the text of the message would appear in the screen of the pager.

## Not so angry americans
More than a third of anger words appeared in messages like these:
![:scale 100%](PagersExample.png)
"Reboot NT machine [name] in cabinet [name] at [location]:CRITICAL:[date and time]."  

The word "critical" is contained in the anger word list of LIWC!

## The issue of machine-generated traces

<!-- <div style="float:right"> -->
<!-- <img src="https://botometer.osome.iu.edu/static/assets/img/banner-logo.png" alt="Botometer" width="400px"/>   -->
<!-- </div> -->

Not all digital traces are generated by humans, a large volume of data is generated by machines. 

During the summer of 2018, Twitter made a big bot cleanse, but independent estimates before reported that between [9% and 15% of Twitter accounts were likely to be bots](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14871/14721). 

One of the most widely used methods to detect bots on Twitter was [Botometer](https://botometer.osome.iu.edu/), which was for a long time in constant development by the [OSoMe lab at Indiana University](https://osome.iu.edu/) (now in archival mode only).
Even if you manage clean bots from your data, you should always take a good look at your text. You can make word clouds, word shift graphs, or just browse through it to see if you notice anomalous patterns. To sum up:

> Take home message: Do not just analyze text, also look at it!

# Representations of text

**Text representation:** computing a fixed-length vector from a text to train a model on the features (values) of the vector

- **TF (Term Frequency) vector:** Using a bag of words assumption, represent each text as a vector of frequencies of the words in the language

- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency):** Same but dividing by the total frequency of the term in all documents
  - Both TF and TF-IDF generate very long vectors (number of possible words) with many zeroes
  - Some approaches to remove rare words or uninformative stopwors
  - Requires design decisions: include punctuation? stem words?

- **Denser representations:** More on those next week

---

# How to train your model
.center[![:scale 65%](supervisedPhases.png)] 

1. **Training:** Texts with annotations of sentiment are used to fit the model  
2. **Validation:** A second set of annotated texts not used for training are used to evaluate the quality of the model: $Q_{1}$  
3. **Testing:** One last evaluation run of the fitted model with a leave-out sample of annotated texts. None of these texts should have been part of the validation or training steps. Testing quality $Q_2$ measures predictive quality of the model.

# Gold Standards and Ground Truths


pos | neg | text  
------------- | ------------- | -------------
0 | 0 |  I wana see the vid Kyan  
0 | 1 | I cant feel my feet.. that cant be good..  
1 | 0 | 10 absolutely jaw dropping concept car designs http://ow.ly/15OnX

- Supervised sentiment analysis needs a set of labeled texts to learn from.
- Labels can come from the author of the text or from reading raters
- The above table is an example from a real dataset with two annotations: a positivity score and a negativity score
- Other ground truths  might have numeric scores in a scale or text labels for basic emotional states.

# Text preprocessing

# What model to use?

Common approaches are:  
1. **Naive Bayes:** Takes features as independent signals and fits the label according to Bayes Rule  
2. **Support Vector Machine:** Finds a separator given a (non-)linear combination of features  
3. **Random Forest:** Finds hierarchical decision rules that divide the texts in classes

In supervised sentiment analysis, generating the ground truth data is the most critical part and is required to train the model. Producing sufficient annotations from readers or authors can be expensive. Supervised methods are usually not out-of-the-box like unsupervised tools, you would have to fit your own model to a ground truth dataset.

# Evaluating classifiers 

- True positives $TP$: All positive cases that are correctly predicted

- False positives $FP$: All negatives that were wrongly predicted as positive

- True negatives $TN$: All negative cases that are correctly predicted 

- False negatives $FN$: All positive cases that were incorrectly predicted as negative

---

# Accuracy, Precision, and Recall
$$Accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+FP+TN+FN}$$
$$Precision = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$
$$Recall = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$  
- The measure of precision answers the question "How sure am I of this prediction?"
- The measure of recall answers the question  "How many of the things that I’m looking for are found?"

---

# Balancing precision and recall

A way to compute a trade-off between Precision and Recall is the $F_1$ score, which is a harmonic mean of Precision and Recall:

$$F_1= 2 ∗ \frac{ Precision ∗ Recall} {Precision + Recall}$$

The $F_1$ score is often used as a way to summarize the quality of classifiers. When more than one class is possible, you should look at the mean of $F_1$ over the classess or to the $F_1$ of each class separately. The $F_1$ score is often used in sentiment analysis competitions to chose the best tools, for example in the [SemEval 2017 competition](https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/index.php?id=tasks).
